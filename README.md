# Domain Scan

An quick rails app to visit a bunch of urls and get a snapshot of the page.

*  ```bundle install```  
*  ```bin/rake db:migrate```
* Update TBD csv file
* visit localhost:3000 

Page might take awhile to load depending on how many urls you're loading. Not a production app, meant to be ran locally, no tests.
